# import necessary libraries(opencv, numpy)


# read the color pallete image (assets/colors.jpg)

# convert image to HSV color space


# define the lower and upper bounds of the color we want to detect


# create a mask for the color

# show mask


# apply mask onto original image to only show the desired color

# show result


# find contours from the mask

# draw rectangles around each contour

# show result
