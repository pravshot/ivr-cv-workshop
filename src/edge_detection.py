# import necessary libraries(opencv, numpy)


# read the cat image (assets/cat1.jpg)

# convert the image to grayscale

# Blur the image for better edge detection with (5,5) kernel

# Apply Canny edge detection with 100, 100 threshold


# display the edges and wait for a keypress


# BONUS: Try applying a dilation/erosion to the edges
